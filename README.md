A technical blog based on [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/):

- using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- with JSON-LD structured data
- with a page for tags (and a page for each tag)
- with a sitemap
- ~~with a RSS feed~~ (was not providing so much value, but it can easily be added back by mimicking the sitemap generation)
- ~~comments with [Vssue](https://vssue.js.org/)~~ (not fully compatible with Vue 3 yet)
